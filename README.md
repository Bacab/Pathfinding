# Pathfinding
This is my attempts to create a simple and efficient algorithm for the robot I'm working on. It basically compute the distance
between each cellule of the array representing the map and the goal. Then it compute a path from it cellule to the costless 
cellule around. In the end is displayed the final trajectory the robot should follow (represented by stars). Star that are not 
connected to the starting point are to be discarded.
